# Sales-Analysis

### Hi, I'm Esha! ðŸ‘‹ , Here are some details of the project:


### Project Overview
This Sales Data Analysis aims to provide the insights of the sales of the company. By analysing the various aspects of the sales data we seek to identify trends, and can gain deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is "all_data.csv" ,containing all the important information of the company sales. I have also added that file in this repository.

### Tools
- Jupiter Notebook [Dowload here](https://jupyter.org/)

### Data Cleaning 
- Data loading and inspection
- Removing all null values in the dataset
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis
Analysis to answer key questions , such as:
1. Which city had the highest number of sales?
2. What is the best time for advertising?

### Results / Findings
San Francisco has the highest number of sales, Best time for advertising is 11 am(11) or 7 pm(19)

### Limitations
I had to remove all the null values, because they can effect the analysis.
